# Active-Noise-Cancelling

# Here i have written the code in the for detecting the charactristic of the noise(like tonal noise,broadband noise,acoustic noise etc...).
   ->Time Plot-It gives the how the amplitude of Noises is changing over the time.
   
   ->FFT- It stand for the Fast Dourier Transform,bascically it convert the signal from time domain to frequency domain
          -here i have plotted the graph between the magnitude of Amplitude(fft) and frequency domain.
          -here peak gives us the information is that how much that frequency is present in the original signal.
